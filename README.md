# Genetic_Algorithm_UTRP
# Thesis Repository

This repository contains the code and resources used in my thesis, which can be accessed in full [here](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1880751/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

## Repository Structure

### Mandl Python

The `Mandl Python` folder includes the implementation of Mandl networks using NetworkX. This can be optimized using a genetic algorithm.

### VISUM

The `VISUM` folder allows users to launch the external program in conjunction with PTV VISUM to optimize public transportation. To use this, a valid PTV VISUM license and network files are required.

### Animation

The `bus_routes_animation.gif` demonstrates how the algorithm works on the Mandl network when optimizing for operator cost (minimizing operator cost).
